# Ralph's Custom Shopify App Node Starter Template

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-green.svg)](LICENSE.md)

Hey! I'm ralph and I made this template for you to use as a starting point for your Node.js/React Shopify App.

Feel free to collaborate on this project and lets empower the Shopify Dev Community!

## Summary

We are using yarn workspaces to segment our projects into multiple packages.
Packages found in `packages`:

- api
- web-app
- _shopify network (coming soon)_

## Running the app

Using the [Shopify CLI](https://github.com/Shopify/shopify-cli) run:

```sh
cd packages/api
shopify app serve
```

## Next Steps

- Add Typeorm ORM to the project with MongoDB (or maybe mongoose and lets forget typeORM?)
- Implement Subscriptions (handling charging customers etc...)
- open to suggestions/more ideas!
